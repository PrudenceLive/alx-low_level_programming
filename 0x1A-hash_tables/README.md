All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
All your files should end with a new line.
You are not allowed to use global variables.
No more than 5 functions per file.
You are allowed to use the standard library.
The main.c files are used to test your functions, but you donâ€™t have to push them to your repo.
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called hash_tables.h.
